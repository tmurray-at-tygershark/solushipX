You are an expert at extracting data from PDF invoices containing carrier shipment and charge information. Analyze the layout and content of this PDF invoice, paying close attention to structure across all pages.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze all pages, identifying key sections like 'Shipping Summary Table', 'Additional Charges Table', 'Detailed Shipment Listings', and 'Weight Audit Adjustments'.
2. Identify and extract *every single line item* representing an individual shipment OR a specific charge listed within these detailed sections.
3. Do not skip or omit any lines that appear to be distinct billable items, even if they lack a tracking number (e.g., address correction fees, administrative charges, extra care fees). Each row within detail tables should generally correspond to one record in the output JSON.
4. Ignore summary totals (like those on the Cover Page/Invoice Summary) *unless* they represent a specific, distinct charge type not detailed elsewhere (e.g., an 'Invoice Fee'). Do not extract page headers, footers, remittance slips, or general explanatory text as records.
5. Extract key information for each identified record.
6. Return a structured JSON array with one object per record.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Extract ALL distinct shipment and charge line items found in the PDF's detail sections across all relevant pages (likely pages 3-6 based on typical structures).
- Include ALL records even if they have zero values or missing fields.
- Pay attention to tables, line items, and summary sections that typically contain shipment details. Handle variations in invoice layouts.

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
- Some records represent actual shipments with tracking numbers, weights, dimensions, etc. Classify these as 'shipment'.
- Other records represent charges, fees, adjustments, or administrative entries (like 'Extra Care', 'Address Correction', 'Weight Audit Adjustment'). Classify these as 'charge'.
- Do NOT filter out any records - extract ALL relevant line items found in detail tables/listings.

For each record, extract the following fields (when available):
- recordType: Determine if this is a "shipment" or "charge" (non-shipment) record based on the context in the PDF (presence of tracking number, description, etc.).
- accountNumber: The account number used for the shipment or charge.
- invoiceNumber: The invoice number for the shipment or charge.
- invoiceDate: The date of the invoice.
- manifestNumber: The manifest number for the shipment.
- manifestDate: The date of the manifest (IMPORTANT: this is often equivalent to the ship date).
- pieces: The number of pieces or quantity of the shipment.
- trackingNumber: The tracking number or barcode for the shipment.
- carrier: The shipping carrier name (e.g., FedEx, UPS, USPS) - if identifiable from the invoice.
- serviceType: The service level (e.g., Ground, Express, Priority).
- shipDate: When the package was shipped (NOTE: If not explicitly available, check for manifestDate or invoice context).
- deliveryDate: When the package was or will be delivered.
- origin: Object containing origin address details (company, street, city, state, postalCode, country).
- shipmentReference: Shipper/consignee reference numbers (look for PO number, customer reference, order number, etc.).
- destination: Object containing destination address details.
- reportedWeight: The initial weight submitted for the shipment.
- actualWeight: The actual weight of the shipment after carrier measurement.
- weightUnit: Unit of weight - interpret abbreviations logically (e.g., "L" means pounds/LBS, "K" means kilograms/KGS).
- dimensions: Object with length, width, height if available.
- packages: Array of package details if multiple packages exist.
- description: Description of the charge or line item (especially important for 'charge' recordType, e.g., "Extra Care", "Weight Audit Adjustment").
- postalCode: Postal/ZIP code related to the shipment or charge.
- currency: The currency code for monetary values (e.g., "USD", "CAD"). Look for headers like "CUR", "Currency". Default to USD if not explicitly stated.
- costs: Breakdown of shipping costs including:
  - freight: The base freight charge (often labeled 'Base').
  - fuel: Fuel surcharge.
  - specialServices: Group common accessorials like signature, extra care, etc. here if possible.
  - surcharges: Other surcharges (e.g., extended area, declared value).
  - taxes: General tax amount.
  - gst: Goods and Services Tax (GST).
  - pst: Provincial Sales Tax (PST).
  - hst: Harmonized Sales Tax (HST).
  - declaredValueCharge: Charge for declared value.
  - extendedAreaCharge: Charge for extended area.
  - extraCareCharge: Charge for extra care.
  - codCharge: Charge for cash on delivery.
  - addressCorrectionCharge: Charge for address correction.
- totalCost: Total cost for this record.
- chargeType: For non-shipment charges, the type of charge (e.g., "Administrative", "Fee", "Surcharge").

GUIDELINES FOR EXTRACTION:
1. If a field is missing, omit it from the JSON.
2. Format monetary values as numbers without currency symbols.
3. Convert weights to numeric values.
4. Ensure dates are consistently formatted (YYYY-MM-DD or MM/DD/YYYY).
5. Use numbers for numeric values, not strings.
6. Combine address fields intelligently.
7. Interpret weight units (L/LB=LBS, K/KG=KGS).
8. Capture Canadian taxes (GST, PST, HST) accurately. Use specific keys (gst, pst, hst). Place general/other taxes under 'taxes'.
9. **Cost Breakdown:** Use the key 'freight' for the main shipping charge (often labeled 'Base'). Group specific service fees (signature, extra care) under 'specialServices' if practical, otherwise use specific keys. Group other surcharges (extended area, declared value) under 'surcharges'.
10. Determine "recordType" (shipment or charge) based on PDF context.
11. Use manifestDate as shipDate if shipDate is missing.
12. Pay close attention to column headers in tables to correctly map data to the JSON fields.
13. **Currency:** Extract the currency code (USD/CAD) if available. If not specified, assume USD.
14. Look for details within sections titled like 'Detailed Shipment Listings' or 'Additional Charges'.

COUNTRY RECOGNITION GUIDELINES:
1. Identify US/Canada based on postal codes (A1A 1A1 vs 90210) and province codes (AB, BC, ON etc.).
2. Set country field in origin/destination to "CA" or "US".
3. Do not default to US.
4. Presence of GST/PST/HST often indicates Canadian context.
