# MARKUP SYSTEM PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

## ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS**

### 1. **Core Markup Engine (`src/utils/markupEngine.js`)**
- ✅ Complete markup application logic with carrier-wide baseline and company-specific overrides
- ✅ Support for multiple markup types: PERCENTAGE, FIXED_AMOUNT, PER_POUND, PER_PACKAGE
- ✅ Dual rate storage system (actualRates vs markupRates)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Role-based rate visibility functions (`canSeeActualRates`)
- ✅ Advanced context matching (weight ranges, geographic conditions)

### 2. **Rate Calculation Integration**
- ✅ Integrated markup engine into `fetchMultiCarrierRates` function
- ✅ Dynamic import to avoid circular dependencies
- ✅ Automatic markup application when `companyId` is provided
- ✅ Enhanced rate fetching with markup metadata in response

### 3. **UI Terminology Updates**
- ✅ Renamed "Business Markups" to "Company Markups" throughout UI
- ✅ Updated file names: `BusinessMarkupsTab.jsx` → `CompanyMarkupsTab.jsx`
- ✅ Updated dialog: `AddEditBusinessMarkupDialog.jsx` → `AddEditCompanyMarkupDialog.jsx`
- ✅ Updated database queries to use `markupScope: 'company'`

### 4. **Shipment Data Storage**
- ✅ Enhanced `CreateShipmentX.jsx` to store dual rates:
  - `actualRates`: Raw carrier rates (cost)
  - `markupRates`: Customer-facing rates with markups applied
- ✅ Markup metadata storage with applied markup details
- ✅ Percentage and amount tracking for audit trails

### 5. **Role-Based Rate Display**
- ✅ Updated `RateDetails.jsx` component with admin/customer view logic
- ✅ Admin users see both cost (actualRates) and charge (markupRates)
- ✅ Customer users only see marked-up rates
- ✅ Professional styling with color coding (green for charges, grey for costs)
- ✅ Markup summary alerts for admin users

### 6. **Database Structure**
- ✅ Existing markup rules system supports all required scenarios
- ✅ Proper field mapping (`fromBusinessId`, `markupScope`)
- ✅ Support for carrier-wide, company-specific, and fixed rate markups
