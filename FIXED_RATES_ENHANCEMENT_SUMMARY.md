## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  markupScope: 'fixedRate',
  companyId: 'specific_company_id' | 'ANY',
  carrierId: 'specific_carrier_id' | 'ANY', 
  service: 'STANDARD' | 'EXPRESS' | 'PRIORITY' | 'ECONOMY' | 'ANY',
  type: 'FLAT_FEE_SHIPMENT' | 'FLAT_FEE_PACKAGE' | 'FLAT_FEE_POUND' | 'PERCENTAGE',
  value: number,
  
  // Geographic targeting
  fromCity: string,
  fromStateProv: string, 
  fromCountry: 'CA' | 'US' | 'MX' | 'ANY',
  fromPostalCode: string,
  toCity: string,
  toStateProv: string,
  toCountry: 'CA' | 'US' | 'MX' | 'ANY', 
  toPostalCode: string,
  
  // Constraints
  fromWeight: number,
  toWeight: number,
  minQuantity: number,
  maxQuantity: number,
  maxLength: number,
  maxWidth: number,
  maxHeight: number,
  
  // Metadata
  priority: number,
  description: string,
  internalNotes: string,
  effectiveDate: ISO_string,
  expiryDate: ISO_string,
  
  // Audit fields
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Client-side Filtering**: Fast filtering without database queries
- **Lazy Loading**: Accordion sections load on demand
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized Firestore queries with proper indexing
- **Caching**: Company and carrier data cached for performance

### Validation Rules
- **Required Fields**: Rate type and value are mandatory
- **Range Validation**: Weight and quantity ranges properly validated
- **Date Validation**: Expiry date must be after effective date
- **Percentage Limits**: Percentage rates capped at 100%
- **Positive Values**: All numeric values must be positive

## Business Impact

### Revenue Generation
- **Sophisticated Pricing Rules**: Enable complex flat-rate pricing strategies
- **Market Segmentation**: Different rates for different companies/routes
- **Competitive Positioning**: Fine-tuned pricing for specific market segments

### Operational Efficiency
- **Automated Application**: Rules apply automatically during rate calculation
- **Priority System**: Handle overlapping rules with precedence
- **Bulk Management**: Efficient creation and management of rate rules

### Compliance & Audit
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All rate changes tracked with timestamps
- **Role-based Access**: Only admins can create/modify rules
- **Documentation**: Internal notes for business justification

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Markup Engine Integration
- Fixed rates override percentage markups when conditions match
- Priority system determines which rule applies for multiple matches
- Seamless integration with existing rate calculation pipeline
