# Smart Status Update & Polling System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive smart status update and polling system implemented for SolushipX. This system provides intelligent, automated shipment status tracking with deduplication, rate limiting, and cross-page synchronization.

## Architecture

The system consists of multiple components working together:

### 1. Background Polling Service (`pollActiveShipments`)
- **Location**: `functions/src/shipment-polling/pollActiveShipments.js`
- **Type**: Scheduled Cloud Function (runs every 30 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Automatically polls active shipments to keep status updated without user interaction

**Features**:
- Polls only non-delivered shipments (pending, booked, scheduled, awaiting_shipment, in_transit, on_hold)
- Rate limiting: minimum 15-minute intervals between polls per shipment
- Batch processing with controlled concurrency (10 shipments at once)
- Smart deduplication to prevent duplicate events
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Support for all carrier types (eShipPlus, Canpar, Polaris Transportation, Ward Trucking, etc.)

### 2. Smart Status Update Service (`smartStatusUpdate`)
- **Location**: `functions/src/shipment-polling/smartStatusUpdate.js`
- **Type**: Callable Cloud Function
- **Purpose**: Provides intelligent status updates when users visit shipment pages

**Features**:
- Intelligent rules to determine when updates are needed
- Rate limiting (max 10 checks per hour per shipment)
- Minimum intervals (5 minutes between checks, 2 minutes for new shipments)
- Advanced deduplication using content hashing and timestamp comparison
- Carrier-agnostic design with specific logic for each carrier type
- Real-time feedback and progress tracking

### 3. Frontend Integration
- **Smart Status Update Hook**: `src/hooks/useSmartStatusUpdate.js`
- **Batch Status Updates**: `src/hooks/useSmartStatusUpdate.js` (useBatchStatusUpdate)
- **Page Integration**: Updated ShipmentDetail.jsx, Shipments.jsx, and Tracking.jsx

## Key Features

### Intelligent Deduplication
The system prevents duplicate events using multiple strategies:

1. **Content Hashing**: Creates MD5 hashes of event content for exact duplicate detection
2. **Timestamp Comparison**: Considers events within 1-5 minutes as potential duplicates
3. **Status Change Logic**: Prevents recording identical status transitions within time windows
4. **Source Tracking**: Distinguishes between user-initiated and system-generated events

### Rate Limiting & Optimization
- **Global Rate Limits**: Maximum 10 status checks per shipment per hour
- **Minimum Intervals**: 5 minutes between manual checks, 15 minutes for background polling
- **New Shipment Logic**: No checks for shipments less than 2 minutes old
- **Final State Logic**: No updates for delivered/cancelled/void shipments

### Carrier Support
The system supports all major carriers with specific logic:

#### eShipPlus Integration
- Uses `bookingReferenceNumber` or `confirmationNumber` for tracking
- Supports freight carriers routed through eShipPlus (Ward Trucking, FedEx Freight, etc.)
- Enhanced history fetching with `getHistoryEShipPlus` integration
- Automatic BOL generation handling

#### Canpar
- Uses `trackingNumber` or `Barcode` for tracking
- Direct API integration with Canpar systems

#### Polaris Transportation
- Uses `confirmationNumber` or `proNumber` for tracking
- Handles test API gracefully with proper error messages
- Production-ready with comprehensive status mapping

### Cross-Page Synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: All pages (Shipments, ShipmentDetail, Tracking) stay synchronized
- **Event Streaming**: Uses Firebase real-time listeners for immediate updates
- **State Management**: Consistent status display across all components
- **Batch Operations**: Shipments page supports batch status updates for multiple shipments

## Usage

### Automatic Background Polling
The system automatically polls active shipments every 30 minutes. No user intervention required.

### Manual Status Refresh
Users can manually refresh status on any page:

1. **ShipmentDetail Page**: Click the refresh icon next to the status
2. **Shipments Page**: Click individual refresh buttons or use batch refresh
3. **Tracking Page**: Click the refresh button in the header

### Batch Operations
On the Shipments page, users can:
1. Select multiple shipments using checkboxes
2. Click "Refresh Status" to update all selected shipments
3. View progress and results in real-time

## Event Types & Sources

The system tracks different event types and sources:

### Event Types
- `status_update`: Status changes (e.g., pending â†’ booked)
- `tracking_update`: New tracking events from carriers
- `status_check`: Manual or automatic status checks

### Event Sources
- `system_polling`: Automated background polling
- `smart_status_update`: User-initiated smart updates
- `user`: Direct user actions
- `carrier_api`: Direct carrier API responses

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. The system uses existing Firebase configuration.

### Deployment
Deploy the new functions using:

```bash
cd functions
npm run deploy
```

Or deploy specific functions:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:pollActiveShipments,functions:smartStatusUpdate,functions:forceStatusRefresh
```

### Monitoring
Monitor the system using Firebase Console:
- **Function Logs**: Check execution logs in Firebase Functions
- **Firestore Events**: Monitor `shipmentEvents` collection for event tracking
- **Error Tracking**: Built-in error handling and logging

## Database Schema

### Shipment Document Updates
New fields added to shipment documents:
- `lastStatusPoll`: Timestamp of last polling attempt
- `lastSmartUpdate`: Timestamp of last smart update
- `statusLastChecked`: Timestamp of last status check
- `lastUpdateSource`: Source of last update ('system_polling', 'smart_status_update', etc.)
- `lastPollError`: Error message from last poll attempt (if any)

### ShipmentEvents Collection
Events are stored with enhanced metadata:
- `trackingUpdateHash`: MD5 hash for deduplication
- `source`: Event source identifier
- `metadata`: Additional context (automated, userInitiated, etc.)
- `carrier`: Carrier name for tracking
- `userData`: User information when applicable

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- **API Failures**: System continues operating with cached data
- **Network Issues**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Rate Limits**: Intelligent spacing of requests
- **Invalid Data**: Robust validation and error recovery

### User Feedback
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time status updates during operations
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Success Notifications**: Confirmation of successful updates
- **Batch Results**: Summary of batch operation results

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimization
- **Hook-based Architecture**: Efficient React state management
- **Memoization**: Optimized re-rendering prevention
- **Batch Processing**: Controlled concurrency for multiple updates
- **Loading States**: Responsive UI during operations

### Backend Optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple shipments efficiently
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections to carrier APIs
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of carrier responses
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create test shipments with different carriers
2. Verify automatic polling occurs every 30 minutes
3. Test manual refresh on all pages
4. Verify deduplication prevents duplicate events
5. Test batch operations with multiple shipments

### Monitoring
- Check Firebase Function logs for execution details
- Monitor `shipmentEvents` collection for proper event recording
- Verify status updates appear correctly across all pages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Duplicate Events
- **Cause**: Race conditions or multiple simultaneous requests
- **Solution**: System automatically deduplicates using content hashing

#### Missing Status Updates
- **Cause**: Rate limiting or minimum interval restrictions
- **Solution**: Wait for minimum interval or use force refresh

#### Carrier API Errors
- **Cause**: Carrier API downtime or authentication issues
- **Solution**: System automatically retries with exponential backoff

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking browser console for detailed operation logs.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Webhook Integration**: Direct carrier webhook support when available
2. **Predictive Analytics**: ML-based delivery prediction
3. **Custom Polling Intervals**: User-configurable polling frequencies
4. **Advanced Notifications**: Push notifications for status changes
5. **Carrier Performance Metrics**: Track carrier API response times and reliability

### Scalability Considerations
- **Regional Deployment**: Deploy functions closer to users geographically
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute polling across multiple function instances
